  bio: Aloha! My name is Boyang Zhang. I am studying physics at UH Manoa. I came to Hawaii from China in Fall 2016. I like the weather and beautiful views here and enjoy the multi-cultural environment very much. I like hiking, playing tennis, trying different restaurants and I want to visit other islands when I am free. Currently, I am doing data analysis with python for a physics research project. Python is one of the most popular and easy-to-learn programming language. If you are interested in learning python, feel free to contact me.
