ICSpark, a college student-run coding program for youth in 6th to 12th grade, is thrilled to announce its upcoming Spring Showcase event on Sunday, May 5th, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM at the Entrepreneur Sandbox. The event will mark the culmination of its 3-month Saturday coding program and celebrate the remarkable achievements of their students in web development.

<br/>

This year holds special significance as ICSpark celebrates its 5th anniversary of empowering young minds through coding education. Since 2019, their neer-peer mentorship model has benefited over 48 college student mentors and 130+ youth. 
The Spring Showcase will feature the final web development projects of talented students in a “science-fair” style. Attendees can walk around the room to interact with presenters as they showcase their projects. Besides interactive websites, there will be activity booths with games and food!

"We are incredibly proud of our students and their accomplishments over the past three months," said Timothy Huo, President of ICSpark. "The Spring Showcase is a testament to their dedication, hard work, and passion for coding. We look forward to sharing their projects with the community and celebrating their success."
Attendees will have a chance to engage with their students, learn more about their programs, and discover the exciting possibilities of coding education. ICSpark and their parent 501(c)3 non-profit organization, Technology Outreach Hawaii (TORCH), invites parents, educators, tech enthusiasts, and the community at large to join them for this special event and support the next generation of innovators. Admission is free, and all are welcome to attend.
