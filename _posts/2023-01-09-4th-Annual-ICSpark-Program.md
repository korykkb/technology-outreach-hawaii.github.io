### What Is ICSpark? 
ICSpark (“I see spark”) is an annual and <strong>FREE</strong> 3-month coding program led by college student mentors at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The mission of ICSpark is to provide every motivated 6th - 12th grade student with a fun, non-intimidating coding environment and access to coding mentorship.

<br/>

### Program Details
<strong>Who</strong>: 6th - 12th grade students, no coding experience required. Classes are led by college students. 

<br/>

<strong>What</strong>: Intro to Web Development Course 

<br/>

<strong>When</strong>: February 4 - May 6, 2023, every Saturday from 9am - 12pm. Signing up is a 3-month commitment, as the course is fast paced. Please sign up only if you know you can commit to attending all sessions. Student-parent orientation and final project showcase date and times to be provided to participants. 

<br/>

<strong>Where</strong>: In person at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, OR online via Zoom.  

<br/>

<strong>Why</strong>: Great opportunity for students to learn from college mentors who are familiar with the challenges of learning to code. Computer science is an invaluable skill for any field of study. 

<br/>

### About the Course 
Classes are highly interactive and project-based. Brief mini-lectures are followed by “live-coding” sessions where the instructor codes and asks participants to follow along by typing on their own screen. Students then work on projects with guidance from mentors. In contrast to the block-based programming style of Scratch, students dive straight into coding on a text editor. By the end of the course, students will create their very own website and be equipped with resources to continue learning.
