This year, we are seeking new leadership (Officers and Directors) to grow our impact and expand our reach. We are excited to welcome fantastic individuals to lead us and our passionate team on our vision towards equipping motivated Hawaii youth with the skills to thrive in the digital landscape of the future. 

<br/>

Since we began our free ICSpark classes in 2019 and formally established our 501(c)3 non-profit organization, Technology Outreach Hawaii (TORCH), in 2021, we have involved over 48 college student mentors and 130 youth participants across our free coding classes and workshops. Now, as we look ahead, we're thrilled to embark on the next chapter of our journey by welcoming new leaders to join us in our mission. 

<br/>

Please apply at <a target="_blank" href="https://bit.ly/hitorch-apply">https://bit.ly/hitorch-apply</a> by April 27, 2024. More information, including expectations and specific roles and responsibilities, can be found on this application form. The Director and Officer term is 2-year and 1-year, respectively. 

<br/>

Candidates will first undergo an application review. Interview offers will be sent to qualified candidates at the end of April and will consist of a virtual meeting with member(s) of our executive leadership team.
