Are you a high school student interested in learning more about technology,  networking with peers, and making a positive community difference during the pandemic?

<br>

Technology Outreach Hawaii is looking for motivated high school students as we build our organization to promote technology education across the island. This is an exciting opportunity for students to learn more about current island-wide "digital literacy" issues, spearhead projects, and build relationships with peers while working towards a common goal. Email us at techoutreachhi@gmail.com with your current CV or resume for consideration.
