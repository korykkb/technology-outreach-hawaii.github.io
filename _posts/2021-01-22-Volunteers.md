Are you a high school or college student interested in learning more about technology,  networking with peers, and making a positive community difference during the pandemic?

<br>

Technology Outreach Hawaii is looking for motivated students as we build our organization to promote technology education across the island. This is an exciting opportunity for students to learn more about current island-wide "digital literacy" issues, spearhead projects, and build relationships with peers while working towards a common goal. If you are interested in volunteering with us, please fill out this [form](https://forms.gle/rJ1SbPssZRpyxzZB9){:target="_blank"} !
