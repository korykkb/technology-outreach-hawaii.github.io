Join us on special Saturdays where we explore technology in different fields of study.

<br>

### What is the TORCH Saturday Workshop?
Our Saturday workshops explore technology in further detail and its use outside of pure computer science. This may involve showing participants how to code or use already developed software to accomplish a task in a different field (for example, biology, art, physics, and more).

<br>

### Do I need to pay to attend these sessions?
No. All sessions are free and open to the public.

<br>

### Who are these sessions geared towards?
We generally gear these sessions towards teens and young adults but are open to anyone interested in learning more about coding.

<br>

### Who are the presenters?
Our presenters consist of college and graduate students who study and have interests in the topics being presented. Our presenters are also not trained speakers or teachers. We depend on our audience members to make the most out of these sessions by asking questions if things are unclear.

<br>

### When are we offering these Saturday workshops?
We plan to offer these special workshops at least once a month. Workshops will generally be 1 - 2 hours. The exact time is specific to the workshop and will be noted on our [Events calendar](https://techoutreachhi.org/events.html){:target="_blank"}.

<br>

### What topics will be covered?
Topics for each session depend on our volunteersâ€™ interests and experiences. The interests of our current team include computer science (web development, data science, and machine learning, cyber security), art, communication, physics, mathematics, economics, biology, and medicine.  

<br>

### Why are we offering this?
Technology is being used in every field. Although coding is one way that advances are being made, it is not the only way. Becoming a skilled user of technological tools while drawing on knowledge from a field outside of computer science augments your ability to do great work more efficiently. Learning to code or use technology in another field of study is a powerful combination that can generate unique ideas for improvements and advances in the field.
