This year we are excited to offer a week of Intro to Web Development workshops prior to our 3-month [ICSpark program](https://icspark.github.io/){:target="_blank"}. Students in 6th - 12th grade are invited to attend and learn more about web development, and interact with our college student mentors. This is a great way to get a taste of what the ICSpark program will be like before signing up for the course.

<br/>

Each workshop will feature the same content, so please sign up for only 1 course in the week as limited space is available. Registration closes on December 10, 2022 and is on a first-sign-up, first-served basis. Students are asked to bring their own laptops to this event.

<br/>
