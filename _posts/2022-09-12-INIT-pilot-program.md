New INIT() pilot program for HS students

<br/>

Bringing CS mentors to the classroom in a new afterschool program 

<br/>

TORCH is excited to launch the Interactive Near-Peer Information and Technology (INIT) after school mentorship program. INIT() is an extracurricular program that involves collaboration between TORCH and a high school teacher to bring college students ("Mentors") to the after school classroom on a weekly basis to provide Computer Science (CS) education and guidance. Mentors provide guidance in the form of lectures, live-coding activities, and/or discussion on CS-related topics. 

<br/>

The purpose of INIT() is to provide high school students with specialized guidance on a wider variety of CS topics outside of the high school curriculum by utilizing the experience of college student Mentors. We are excited to be partnering with one classroom this year to pilot this program and hope that it will inspire students to continue learning and developing their technological skills. 

<br/>

We will be sharing the results of this program towards the end of the academic year. If successful, we may open this program to additional schools next year. Subscribe to our newsletter for major updates!
