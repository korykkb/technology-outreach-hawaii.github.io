      <h2>ICSpark</h2>
      <p>ICSpark is a Registered Independent Organization (RIO) at the University of Hawaii. ICSpark began with a desire to offer coding programs to students at a younger age. Our founding undergraduate students believed that early education would be invaluable to kickstart a career in CS, and in developing the critical thinking and skills necessary to succeed in any sector in the 21st century.</p>
